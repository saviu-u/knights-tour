# knights-tour

This repo contains a simple python project to solve the "Knight's tour problem"
It uses OOP to make it simple to understand

DISCLAIMER: it's not optimized, because it is intended to use search trees and backtracking to track the fastest solution for academic purposes
it's also intended to be easy to read, so neither the algorithm or the code is optimized to its best
